# DVCards Contributing Policy

1.    Contributors are welcome — All contributions are encouraged, including bug reports, feature requests, and code changes.
2.    Follow the Code of Conduct — The same rules from the Code of Conduct apply, along with these additional guidelines.
3.    Don’t break the code intentionally — It’s pointless and against the spirit of the project.

5.   Don’t troll — If you're contributing, do it with good intentions.
6.    Be civil — Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
7.    Ask questions — If you're unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask. Someone will likely help you.
